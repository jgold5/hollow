# Hollow

Hollow is a minimal static site generator focused on clarity over features.

It takes Markdown content, renders it through a small, explicit template contract, and writes predictable HTML output. No plugins, no magic, no hidden state.

## Philosophy

- One clear build path  
- Explicit data flow  
- Boring, debuggable behavior  

If you can trace the build in your head, Hollow is doing its job.
